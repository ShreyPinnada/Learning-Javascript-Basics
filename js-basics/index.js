//DYNAMIC TYPING

//JS is a dynamic language i.e unlike static languages
// say we declare let name = string we can change the value to anything during runtime

/*typeof name
'string'
name = 1
1
typeof name
'number'*/

// in js theres no int or float all of them come under numbers

//undefined is also a value and type both
//type of null will be an object
