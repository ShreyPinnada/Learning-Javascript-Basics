let interestRate = 0.3;
interestRate = 1;
console.log(interestRate);
//obviously we will be able to see the new interestRate

//say we dont want a value in variable to change we use constant
const interest = 0.4;
interest = 8;
console.log(interest);
//this will result in an error

//BEST PRACTICE: if you dont want a value to change use const else use let
