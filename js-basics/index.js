//before es6 we used 'var' but it has some issues

//going forward from es6 we use the 'let' keyword as the best practice

let name = 'Shrey';
console.log(name);

//rules for variable names we already know
// Cannot be a reserved keyword
//Should be meaningful
// Cannot start with a number
// Cannot contain a space or hyphen
// Case Sensititve

//some valid variable declarations are given below:

let firstName; //better to use Camel case

//decalring multiple variables
let first = 'shrey' , last = 'pinnada';
//modern best practice is to have in seperate lines
let firstN = 'shrey';
let lastN = 'pinnada';
